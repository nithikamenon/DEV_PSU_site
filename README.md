# My_Personal_Site 
## about: This is my first website! Making the site was my first exposure to html and css. It is a personal website.

## great features: 1. It is smooth scroll 2. The active header- takes you to respective parts of the site  3. Contact form to reach me

## areas to improve: This site was made on my laptop and does not configure well to other devices. The contact section requires the download of a mail app to use


### about the site: 1. The site is not published due to my name being on it and pictures with my identity. I was given the idea of a personal website, but I if to decide again I would choose another topic for my site. 

## please reach out if you would like a zip of the project to download and view yourself
